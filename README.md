# AoC2023Talk - Not All Instances of Hard Problems are Difficult
A talk on some problems from AoC 2023.

### Abstract
When faced with hard problems, programmers will tend to think of all of the ways that a problem may be made even more complex - edge cases are considered, scaling behavior is considered, memory efficiency is considered, and so on.
Sometimes, however, simpler is better.
With small inputs, efficiency may not be neccesary.
Edge cases may not need to be considered, or better yet - a particular edge case in the input may simplify the approach greatly.
The potential for simple solutions for difficult problems is especially present in programming puzzles such as Advent of Code, where the problem and inputs are carefully crafted to allow for the challenging problems to be solved with a bound on creativity instead of computation.
In this talk, we explore some of the problems from the Advent of Code 2023 contest and the "tricks" that make these problems simpler than they first appear.
